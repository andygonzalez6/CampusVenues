## Problem Statement
The room booking process is needlessly challenging. For student club leaders who are busy with classwork, searching for internships, and managing their organizations, the extra time and inconvenience means the difference between putting on a valuable event for their student body or postponing and canceling the event altogether. For staff with multiple responsibilities, the lack of a communication platform can lead to delays.

## User Classes 
Users affected by this problem are involved in the booking of rooms on campus for events. This mainly involves two parties interacting with each other.
### Students holding leadership positions on campus that need to reserve rooms for events
- Looking to reserve the optimal room for their activities
- Want information as soon as possible to streamline club activities and be able to juggle school work
- Time is valuable and any inconveniences cause major setbacks
### Staff members who manage room reservations requests for events.
-   Want as little miscommunication and conflict as possible
-   Must take into account various factors and make decisions on their own judgment
-   Often has to compensate for miscommunication or lack thereof
-   Has to worry about more than just giving a room to a group of people

## User Interviews

We conducted four interviews with two members from each of our user classes. From the interviews, we formualted user goals and scenarios.

## User Goals
### Student goals
- Easier access to documentation for how to book rooms in general, as this would contribute to learnability as well as help students who are booking rooms for the first time (not related to existing systems, but in general)
- Reasonably fast response times to room confirmations and better communication
- Students are already overloaded with school work, UI should/can be less overwhelming/inconvenient
- Process should be more flexible and should be faster with repetitive use 


### Staff goals
- Resolve unnecessary conflicts with double-bookings and miscommunications
- Shorten process to assign rooms to students
- Standardize/streamline coordination with different departments/buildings
- Minimize inconsistencies and delays with the reservation process


## Task Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Student-Side Mobile Application
Leon has just finished a meeting with his fellow student club officers. Leon was assigned with booking a room for the club’s next big event (goal). Leon has never done this before, but has been provided with a newly created website, CampusVenues! First, Leon logs in to the website (subtask 1). Then, Leon clicks the “view documentation” button to get more information about how to book a room (subtask 2). Then, Leon returns to the home page and filters rooms based on his club’s needs (subtask 3). Then, Leon scrolls through the rooms that match and checks out details of specific rooms (subtask 4). Unfortunately, some rooms are grayed out as they have already been booked. Finally, Leon selects 3 rooms he thinks are the best fit (subtask 5). Leon then enters his event details (subtask 6). With one click of a confirmation button (subtask 6), Leon has finished the booking process with no previous experience! He can now click on his account button (subtask 7). From there, he can click on the drop-down menu to view his past bookings and await confirmation (subtask 8). One week later, Leon gets a mobile notification (subtask 9). He opens the application and clicks account->past bookings. His room has been confirmed by a staff member (subtask 10)!

### Scenario 2: Staff-Side Website
Sally works for her local university and is just about to finish a long day at work. All she has to do now is review pending requests for managing and booking rooms, CampusVenues. She wants to get through all requests as efficiently and quickly as possible, without much conflict (Goal). Sally first logs in to the website (Task 1). Then, Sally clicks the “view requests” button to see a list of room requests, sorted by requested date (Task 2).  Sally then clicks the top-most request to view the details (Task 3). Sally then reviews the request, selects the room she thinks is the best fit, and approves the booking (Task 4). The time slot for the room booked is automatically grayed out and can no longer be used. Sally then goes back to the list of requests and selects the next room request. After looking a t the request details, she realizes this request asks for the same room and time as the previous one. Sally clicks on the communication page and tries to get in contact with the student requesting the room (Task 5). Luckily the student answers almost immediately. They compromise on a room that works for the student, and Sally clicks back to the request page, where the request is still pending. Sally goes to review the request, in which she is greeted with a pending approval page (Task 6). She is then able to approve the booking. After going through a few more requests, Sally runs into a problem with a booking with multiple departments. To solve this problem, Sally clicks on the department contact menu to communicate with said departments (Task 7). The conversation happens quickly and efficiently, so that any conflicts can be solved in a timely manner. Sally then finishes up approving all requests and has finished her work for the day. 

## Usability Analysis

Usability Analysis was conducted with through usability testing using our task scenarios conducted on 8 other engineering students. Feedback was observed and implemented into the final design

Furthermore, we conducted usability testing with members of our user classes from our university, and implemented the feedback to our final design.
